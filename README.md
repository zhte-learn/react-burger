# React SPA with Redux, TypeScript, WebSocket

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using React and Redux for state management, React Router for routing, and WebSocket for real-time communication.
The application also uses TypeScript for type safety and includes testing with Cypress and Jest to ensure the functionality and reliability of the codebase.

## The app is available

## Features
### Dynamic Routing with React Router
### State Management with Redux
### Authentication & Authorization:
Login and registration, utilizing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication. Protected routes are configured to only allow authenticated users to access certain resources.
### Real-Time Communication with WebSocket:
Using the WebSocket protocol, the app establishes a persistent connection with the server, enabling updates that don't require the user to refresh the page.
### TypeScript for Type Safety
### Testing with Cypress & Jest
